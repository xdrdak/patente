# Patente

> St'une belle patente Ã§a

Patente is an experimental way of creating step-by-step UI wizards using generator functions.

It is inspired by CLI tools of the same nature; You write code in a procedural manner and things render
on screen in a procedural way. 

Patente leverages generator functions and good old javascript. The intent is to not build a meta-language
on top of yaml or start straight from a wysiwyg editor, but rather use the already expressive nature 
of javascript to build out wizards. Think "less-code", rather than codeless or "configful"
